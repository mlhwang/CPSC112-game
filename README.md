CPSC112-game
=============

This is intended as an instruction module to teach intro students about
loops, arrays, objects, and the like.
This is based off David Saltares's [code](https://github.com/siondream/freegemas-gdx),
which is based off José Tomás Tocino García's [code](http://code.google.com/p/freegemas/),
which is based off the classic game of Bejeweled.

###Assignments###

Just delete sections of the code and ask students to fill in the blanks.
Most likely, you will be interested in asking students to rewrite part of
Board.java or possibly other files in the freegemas folder (the logic)


###Setup/Installation###

follow the instructions on how to [set up](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=i)
the development environment. Then download the github project as a zip file and import in Eclipse.
